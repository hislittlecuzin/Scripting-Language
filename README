How to script

You need to include an "info.txt" file. This file will have the names of all the scripts you intend to run when you start the application. 
This file will be in the .exe directory. 

Each line will have the relative filepath from the .exe to the other scripts. 
If you have all the scripts in the same directory, you can just list the full filename. For example info.txt will have the scripts 
"Script A" & "Script B"
The info.txt file will have the literal contents:
"Script A.txt
Script B.txt"


Variables:

To create an array you initialize it on one line then add variables on subsequent lines. 
"array foo
arr bar
list foobar"

Add new values with input. 
read a foo
read arr bar
read array foo
read list foobar

Printing:

You can also print to the screen with "show" "print" or "write"
"var x 1
show x
show This text will print literally.
array newArray
read a newArray
show newArray 0"

Looping:

You can also loop through commands. You can for loop count up or for loop count down.
Counting up counts from 0 to the number indicated & counting down counts from the indicated number to 0.
"for cu 10
show From 0 to 10
end
for cd 10
show From 10 to 0
end"
